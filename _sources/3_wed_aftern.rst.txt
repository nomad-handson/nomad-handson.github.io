Data Analytics II: Cluster Expansion & Thermodynamics
------------------
=========================================
Wednesday, 14:30 â€“ 18:30
=========================================

This tutorial shows how to predict the ground-state configurations of a binary alloy,
starting from a set of ab-initio calculations for random distributions of the substituent species.
This is achieved through a cluster expansion (CE) of the energy of mixing of the alloy and a configurational sampling.
The system studied in this tutorial is the alloy Si\ :subscript:`1-x`\ Ge\ :subscript:`x`\ .
The user can specify the parameters determining the quality of the CE and the configurational sampling.
The tasks are performed with the cluster expansion package **CELL** - Cluster Expansion for large parent ceLLs.
