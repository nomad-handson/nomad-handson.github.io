Predicting energy differences between crystal structures: (Meta-)stability of octet-binary compounds
------------------

This tutorial shows how to find descriptive parameters (short formulas) that predict the crystal structure
(here, rocksalt (RS), zincblende (ZB), CsCl, NiAs or CrB), using the example of octet binary compounds.
It is based on the algorithm Sure Independence Screening followed by L0 minimization (SIS+L0),
that enables to search for optimal descriptor by scanning huge feature spaces.
